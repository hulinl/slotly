              Slotly is a scheduling service operated by <strong>bifactory s.r.o.</strong>,
              Czech Republic. The data controller for personal information processed
              by Slotly is bifactory s.r.o. You can reach us at{" "}

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Data we collect</h2>
            <p>When you use Slotly we collect only what we need to run the service:</p>
            <ul className="ml-5 list-disc space-y-1">
              <li>
                <strong>Account details</strong> — email address, first and last name,
                optional avatar and phone number. Provided by you at sign-up (or by
                Google / Microsoft if you sign in via SSO).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Working hours &amp; unavailability</strong> — the weekly hours
                you are open for meetings and any "out of office" blocks you add.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Calendar free/busy data</strong> — busy intervals from calendars
                you connect (Google Calendar via OAuth, or ICS feed URLs you paste).
                We do <em>not</em> store event titles, attendees or bodies from your
                calendars; we only store the start/end times and whether the block is
                busy or free.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Booking metadata</strong> — meetings you create through Slotly
                or that someone books via your public link. We store the participants'
                emails, meeting time, and any title/notes you or the visitor provided.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>OAuth tokens</strong> — when you connect Google or Microsoft,
                we store access and refresh tokens so we can create events on your
                behalf. Tokens are encrypted at rest with a per-deployment key.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Basic technical logs</strong> — IP address, user-agent, and
                timestamps for security and rate-limiting. Kept for at most 30 days.

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">How we use Google user data</h2>
            <p>
              Slotly&apos;s use of information received from Google APIs adheres to the{" "}
              <a
                className="underline"
                href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy"

                Google API Services User Data Policy
              </a>
              , including the Limited Use requirements.
            </p>
            <p>Specifically, Google data is used only to:</p>
            <ul className="ml-5 list-disc space-y-1">
              <li>Read free/busy times from your Google Calendar to compute your availability.</li>
              <li>Create events in the calendar you selected as the write target, when you or a visitor books a meeting.</li>
              <li>Display your name, email, and avatar (from Google userinfo) in your Slotly profile.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We do <strong>not</strong> sell, share, or use Google user data for
              advertising. We do not use it to train AI/ML models. Human review of
              this data only happens when strictly necessary to investigate abuse,
              debug a specific customer-reported bug you asked us to look into, or
              comply with law.
            </p>

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Sharing</h2>
            <p>
              We don&apos;t sell your data. We share it only with the third-party
              providers we need to run the service:
            </p>
            <ul className="ml-5 list-disc space-y-1">
              <li>
                <strong>Google</strong> and <strong>Microsoft</strong> — for the OAuth
                connections you initiate and the calendar events you or your visitors
                create through Slotly.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Microsoft Azure</strong> (EU region) — our infrastructure
                provider (compute, database, blob storage, email).
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              When a visitor books time via your public link, the visitor&apos;s email
              and name are shared with your calendar provider so they can be added as
              an event attendee. That is the only outward sharing of visitor data.

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Public booking link</h2>
            <p>
              When you enable your public booking link, anyone with the URL can see
              your free/busy availability for the next 8 weeks and, if you have a
              calendar connected, book time with you. They see your display name,
              country, and avatar; they never see your email or the titles of
              events on your calendar. You can turn the link off or rotate it at any
              time from your profile page.

              <li>Account data — for as long as your account exists.</li>
              <li>OAuth tokens — until you disconnect the integration or delete your account.</li>
              <li>Cached calendar events — up to 90 days after they end; older entries are purged automatically.</li>
              <li>Booking requests — indefinitely, so you have a record; you can delete individual rows on request.</li>
              <li>Technical logs — up to 30 days.</li>

              from your account settings. Full account deletion (Settings → Account →
              Delete account) removes all your data within 24 hours, except backups
              that expire on their own rolling schedule (max 30 days). You can also
